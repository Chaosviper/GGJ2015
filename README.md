# GGJ2015
Game developed for the Global Game Jam 2015 with Unity3D (Scripts written in C#)

This code has been written in 2 days by four programmers, so it isn't so well designed.

*Commando pattern, Commando pattern everywhere*

A game's little description:
Ogre simulator 2015 is a 2 players co-op game where you're a two headed ogre, and each player controls one of his heads. 
This means that a player controls the left ogre's arm and the second player controls the right arm.
